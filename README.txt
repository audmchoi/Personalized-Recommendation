# In this program I want to try and take information about peoples previous favorite movies and based on that information, give them movie or tv show reccomendations. I think it would be easier to focus on just movies or just tv shows and to focus from one platform. I want to be able to apply some sort of assesment and use that information to predict what would be enjoyed.
# A function that creates a test and returns a type/genre they like 
# A function that is able to pick movies from that genre to recommend

Im starting with a loose outline of the code first
it will ask for the persons favorite movie and link it with a genre, then select a movie to recommend from the set list of movies. The fuction def recommend_movies will select movies in the same genre as the favorite movie.
I want this to all happen in a tkinter so I will import tkinter. I will work on the shape and colors (making it pretty) later.
Im goint to make a list of movie_recommendations with each genre. Later I'm going to make a file for each genre with a long list of movies of that genre. This will help me have the best recommendations. I think I'm also going to try and use this same method to associate answers of the "personality test" with genres. 
Then I will have a function that will recommend something from that same list that the favorite movie was taken from (later it will be the files)

There are tk buttons i have made but more will definetly be needed as the questions proceed 
- last question and next question buttons 
It will be multiple choice questions but where the word needs to be typed still. 

Ill work backwards from there by inputting more questions in order to select a genre
