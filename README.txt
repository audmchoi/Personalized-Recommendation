# In this program I want to try and take information about someone's personality and based on that information, give them movie or tv show reccomendations. I think it would be easier to focus on just movies or just tv shows and to focus from one platform. I want to be able to apply some sort of personality assesment and use that information to predict what would be enjoyed.
# A function that creates a personality test and returns a type (might switch to previous shows or movies that they enjoyed)
# A function that applies this personality and decides genre preference 
# A function that is able to pick movies from that genre to recommend
